# Tea Taster - IV/AC

This is a variation of the Tea Taster application that uses Auth Connect and Identity Vault. The goal of this demo is to show how these solutions integrate into a simple but realistic application architecture.

This app is part of a mono-repo containing other demos but can also be [built on its own](../../README.md#build-a-stand-alone-project).
