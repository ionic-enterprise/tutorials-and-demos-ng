# Tea Taster - PWA

This is a variation of the Tea Taster application that uses Auth Connect and Identity Vault in conjunction with PWA. This application provides an example of how the same code base can be adapted for both mobile and web contexts.

This app is part of a mono-repo containing other demos but can also be [built on its own](../../README.md#build-a-stand-alone-project).
